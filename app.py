You are an expert resume and job matching analyst with deep experience in evaluating candidate-job fit. Your task is to provide a comprehensive analysis of how well the candidate's resume matches the job requirements.

CANDIDATE'S RESUME:
{resume_text}

JOB POSTING TO ANALYZE:
{job_text}

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **SKILL MATCH ANALYSIS** (Be reasonable but accurate):
   - Extract key required skills/qualifications from the job posting
   - Compare each requirement against the resume content
   - For each skill: state if it's present, partially present, or missing
   - Consider related experience and transferable skills
   - Look for equivalent technologies and methodologies
   - Be reasonable about skill variations (e.g., experience with ChatGPT/LangChain counts for GPT-4 experience)

2. **EXPERIENCE RELEVANCE**:
   - Evaluate if the candidate's work experience directly relates to the job requirements
   - Consider industry relevance, role similarity, and project scope
   - Recognize when experience in similar domains is transferable
   - Distinguish between "directly relevant" and "related" experience

3. **EDUCATION & CERTIFICATIONS**:
   - Check if required degrees/certifications are present
   - Evaluate if the field of study is relevant to the job requirements
   - Consider equivalent qualifications and self-taught expertise

4. **CONFIDENCE RATING CRITERIA** (0-100 scale):
   - 0-20: No relevant skills or experience, completely different field
   - 21-40: Some tangential skills but major gaps in core requirements
   - 41-60: Partial match with some relevant skills but missing key requirements
   - 61-80: Good match with most requirements met, minor gaps
   - 81-100: Excellent match with all or nearly all requirements met

5. **MISSING CRITICAL SKILLS**:
   - List specific skills/qualifications that are required but not found in the resume
   - Prioritize by importance to the role
   - Distinguish between "missing" and "could be learned quickly"

6. **HIGHLIGHT OPPORTUNITIES**:
   - Identify transferable skills that could be emphasized
   - Suggest how to frame existing experience to better match the role
   - Note any adjacent skills that could be relevant

7. **RECOMMENDATION**:
   - Should the candidate apply? (Yes/No/Maybe with explanation)
   - What would be the biggest challenges in this role?
   - What would be the candidate's strongest selling points?

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS:
**SKILL MATCH ANALYSIS:**
[List each requirement and match status - be reasonable about related experience]

**EXPERIENCE RELEVANCE:**
[Detailed assessment]

**EDUCATION & CERTIFICATIONS:**
[Assessment]

**CONFIDENCE RATING: X/100**
[Explanation of rating]

**MISSING CRITICAL SKILLS:**
[List with priority]

**HIGHLIGHT OPPORTUNITIES:**
[Specific suggestions]

**RECOMMENDATION:**
[Clear yes/no/maybe with reasoning]

GUIDELINES:
- Be reasonable about skill equivalencies (e.g., LangChain experience = LLM experience)
- Consider the candidate's demonstrated ability to learn and adapt
- Recognize when experience in similar domains is highly transferable
- Be honest but fair in your assessment
